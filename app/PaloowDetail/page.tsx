<p>1. Google Form Survey
I designed and shared a Google Form survey targeting potential users from diverse backgrounds. The survey focused on understanding:
How users currently manage their daily services like bills, shopping, learning, investment.
Their frustrations with using multiple apps.
Their expectations from an all-in-one platform.
Features that would motivate them to switch to a single ecosystem.
Key Insights from the Survey:
90% of users preferred a one-time profile setup over filling out information multiple times.
45% found it annoying to switch between different apps for different needs.
80% were interested in getting discounted rates through reseller opportunities.</p>

Real pain points around inconsistent user experiences across apps.
Concerns about security and ease of payments.
Positive reception towards having a unified learning and investment platform.
Key Insights from Interviews:
Users want a platform they can trust with both personal and financial information.</p>

<p>This section presents the ideal users for Payloow, capturing their backgrounds, goals, frustrations, and behavior patterns. By understanding their needs and motivations, we ensure the product is designed to solve real problems and deliver a smooth, rewarding experience.
My User Flow section outlines the journey a typical user takes when interacting with Payloow — from account registration, profile setup, and navigating between the mini-apps like Bills, EasyBuy, E-learning, Investment, to completing specific tasks like purchasing, investing, or learning. This flow helps structure the app and ensure its design to feel intuitive and minimize user effort.</p>
